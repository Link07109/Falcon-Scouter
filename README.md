# FalconScoutApp
Ionic remake of the original android scouting app used by FRC 5190 during the FIRST Power Up season.

- Uses Cloud Firestore for the storage of all scouting data.
- Uses The Blue Alliance's v3 HTTP API for retrieval of event and team specific information such as the teams competing and their ccwm.
